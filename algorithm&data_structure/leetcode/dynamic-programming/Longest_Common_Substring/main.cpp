/*
*  Longest Common Substring Problem:
1. Data Deduplication: Finding common substrings can help in identifying duplicate data for deduplication purposes.
2. String Search Algorithms: Longest common substrings are used in algorithms like the Rabin-Karp for string searching.
3. Genetic Algorithms: In genetic algorithms, common substrings can represent genetic material that is passed from one generation to the next.
4. Pattern Recognition: In pattern recognition, finding common substrings can help identify recurring patterns in data.
5. Web Search: Some search algorithms use longest common substrings to find similar web pages.
